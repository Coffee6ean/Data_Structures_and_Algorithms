# Senior Full-Stack Developer Study Plan - DSA Focus

## üö® **PRIORITY 1: DSA Patterns (Daily Practice - 8 weeks)**

### **üéì LEARNING PROGRESSION STRATEGY - "TRAINING WHEELS" REMOVAL**

**CRITICAL NOTE: How to approach problems within each pattern for maximum learning:**

#### **Pattern Learning Progression (Per Pattern):**

**Problem 1-2: Full "Learn-Then-Implement"**
- Watch solution video first (10-15 min) - Understand approach & pattern
- Close everything and implement from scratch (20-30 min)
- Focus on understanding the "why" behind each step
- **Goal**: Build the pattern template in your brain

**Problem 3: "Peek Method"**
- Try solving for 15-20 minutes first (no videos)
- If stuck ‚Üí Watch ONLY the approach explanation (not the code)
- Close video ‚Üí Implement yourself
- **Goal**: Test if you can recognize the pattern independently

**Problem 4-5: "Pure Attempt"**
- Try for 30-45 minutes solo (depending on difficulty)
- Only watch video if completely stuck after genuine attempt
- **Goal**: Build real interview confidence and problem-solving skills

#### **Difficulty-Based Time Boxing:**
- **Easy Problems**: Always try first (15 min max) - These test pattern recognition
- **Medium Problems**: Learn-then-implement for first 1-2, then try solo (25-30 min max)
- **Hard Problems**: Always attempt first (45+ min max) - These test pattern combinations

#### **"Partial Learning" When Stuck:**
1. **Step 1**: Watch only "Approach" section (high-level strategy, no code)
2. **Step 2**: Look at algorithm steps/pseudocode (if still stuck)
3. **Step 3**: Watch full solution (last resort) ‚Üí then implement from memory

#### **Green Flags (Ready for "Try First"):**
- ‚úÖ You can explain previous problem's approach clearly
- ‚úÖ You recognize "this feels like [pattern]" within 2-3 minutes  
- ‚úÖ You can write the basic template/structure without looking

#### **Red Flags (Watch Video First):**
- ‚ùå Still confused about when to use the pattern
- ‚ùå Previous problem took multiple attempts to understand
- ‚ùå Can't explain why the pattern works

## üéØ **Assessment: Is Udemy Course + Practice Enough?**

### **Strengths of Your Udemy Course:**
- **Solid Foundation:** Covers all fundamental data structures
- **Communication Framework:** Teaches how to explain your approach
- **Interview Mindset:** Focuses on problem-solving process
- **Practical Examples:** Real coding interview scenarios

### **What You'll Need to Supplement:**
- **Pattern Recognition:** The course teaches data structures, but FAANG interviews test pattern recognition
- **Advanced Techniques:** Some patterns like "Monotonic Stack" or "Union Find" may not be covered
- **Speed & Efficiency:** Need more volume of practice problems
- **Amazon-Specific Problems:** Course is general, not company-specific

### **Recommendation: Course + Supplements**
**The Udemy course is perfect for your foundation (Weeks 1-2), but add these supplements:**

1. **Pattern Recognition (Week 3+):** Use the 15 patterns I listed as a checklist
2. **Volume Practice:** 200+ problems across patterns (course alone won't give you this)
3. **Amazon Focus:** Filter LeetCode by Amazon tag for company-specific practice
4. **Advanced Patterns:** YouTube/articles for patterns not covered in course
